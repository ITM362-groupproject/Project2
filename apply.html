The SoA wiki admission pages provide extensive information about applying to Yaleâ€™s MFA program. Use this as your resource while preparing an application. Questions that are not easily answered via these pages may be directed to our office, either via email art.admissions@yale.edu or phone (during business hours), with the understanding that Yale does not provide personalized portfolio review or advisement about the content of applicant submissions. Application status and receipt of documents can be checked within the status portal at the application link above, after an application has been submitted. Applicants SHOULD NOT CONTACT Yale School of Art faculty and/or current students seeking program information, application and/or portfolio advisement. Please respect the personal/private spaces (such as email, social media, direct message, etc.) and time of our community by utilizing the wiki and, when necessary, directing your inquiries appropriately to those whose job it is to assist you. Thank you!</p>
